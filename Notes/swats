- very appealing filtering system, should look into implementing it.
- map being a mostly seperate modal style thing is good.


- unappealing layout in general, not many positives.
- only real thing to take from this is that some sort of global search bar would be a positive.








Perhaps map would not need to always be shown, personal page could have more of a traditional grid layout with place objects having a "view on map" button, this would either scroll up to the map or make a map object appear.

-Instagram grabbing images for objects? can that even be done?

-some sort of rating API for food and drinks.

-a featured section?
