Aimed at tourists/people from outside Wellington. (add some form of translation + Maori points)

Map-based interface(google maps, restricted to NZ).

Motels, Restaurants, Scenic spots all visible on map(probably add some filtering functionality)

User should be able to,
	View destinations(motels, etc.)
	Learn more about a destination(Tripadviser, infobox)
	Have the option to go to destinations website.
	Search destinations by catagory(autocomplete search, filtering)
	Find the way to destination from current location(presumably google maps functionality)
	Visualize destinations based on the number of instagram/twitter mentioms(mentions can be mocked up using personal accounts, Maybe part of infobox?)

Provide placeholder JSON location data(for real destinations in Wellington)
Need a google API key

NO ERRORS! >:U
-Project stored on github
-Team needs javascript style guide, all code must meet this before merging with master.

Prototypes and use cases should be made prior to coding.

Dependencies must be managed, probably using grunt, could be added later in development
